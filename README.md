ðŸŽ“ # Football Data Analytics Portfolio âš½
Welcome to my Football Data Analytics portfolio, which documents my ongoing learning journey in this field. Here, youâ€™ll find a variety of projects where Iâ€™ve replicated and adapted work from other creators, applying their methodologies to different case studies as a way to deepen my understanding of the techniques involved. All such work is properly credited to the original authors.

Throughout this portfolio, I use a wide range of toolsâ€”including packages, modules, and functionsâ€”from external repositories. These are always clearly referenced to help guide the reader and ensure reproducibility. Just as I value well-documented and accessible projects that support learning, I strive to follow those same principles in my own work. Tools Iâ€™ve personally developed to streamline analyses can be found in the Analysis Tools folder.

Iâ€™m driven by continuous learning and deeply interested in all aspects of Football Data Science and Analysis. This portfolio reflects that curiosity, aiming to cover a broad spectrum of the data workflowâ€”including scraping, engineering, exploration, modeling, and visualization.

Finally, I uphold a strict policy against irresponsible data scraping. No scraped data is stored in this repository, nor do I support practices that may negatively impact source websites. However, I believe thatâ€”when done responsibly, transparently, and solely for educational, non-commercial purposesâ€”data scraping can be a powerful tool for learning. Respecting server limitations and terms of service is essential, and I view ethical data scraping as an opportunity to explore real-world datasets while upholding high standards of integrity and respect for data ownership.
